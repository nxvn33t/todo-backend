## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you can run the Backend Todo App, make sure you have the following software installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - JavaScript runtime environment.
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) - Package managers for Node.js.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/backend-todo-app.git
   ```

2. Change to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd backend-todo-app
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Usage

To start the Backend Todo App, run the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

The server will start running on port 3000 by default. You can access the application at `http://localhost:3000`.

## API Endpoints

The API provides the following endpoints for managing Todo tasks:

- `GET /api/tasks`: Retrieve a list of all tasks.
- `POST /api/tasks`: Create a new task.
- `GET /api/tasks/:id`: Retrieve a specific task by ID.
- `PUT /api/tasks/:id`: Update a specific task by ID.
- `DELETE /api/tasks/:id`: Delete a specific task by ID.

You can use tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [curl](https://curl.se/) to interact with these endpoints.

## Database

The Backend Todo App uses a database to store task data. By default, it uses a MongoDB database for local development. In a production environment, you can configure it to use a different database system such as MySQL or PostgreSQL.

## Configuration

You can configure the application by modifying the `config.js` file. Here, you can specify the database connection details, port, and other settings.

## Testing

To run the tests for the Backend Todo App, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

This will execute the test suite and report the results.
